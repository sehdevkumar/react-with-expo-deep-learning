# Stack Navigation vs Tab Navigation
  What is the difference between stack navigation and tab navigation?
   Example:
   - Stack navigation is often used for navigation between screens within a single app, while tab navigation is often used for navigation between screens in different apps or within a single app.

   
# Grouping Screens
   (g1,g2)
    _layout.tsx
    g1.tsx
    g2.tsx
