You feel a sense of belonging, a sense of being part of something bigger than yourself. You feel a sense of security, a sense of protection that you don't feel anywhere else.

It is a place where you can be yourself, without fear of what others may think of you. It is a place where you can be yourself, without fear of being judged.
